  <p>The University of Maryland recently announced a $36 million investment to build a 60,000 square-foot performance center, which will house the men’s and women’s basketball new practice facility.</p>

  <p>This announcement comes just five years after announcing a $196 million renovation of Cole Field House that was set to catapult the university’s athletic facilities to be among the Big Ten and national elite.</p>

  <p>Both, Cole Field House and the new performance center provide coaches and student-athletes with resources now and in the future for recruiting purposes.</p>

  <p>Students have made their frustration known about the athletic department’s plans. These students believe that funding for the athletic department is too large and takes away from more important resources for students. Additionally, they believe the fundraising campaigns could be more useful in other areas. </p>

  <p>An opinion article, written by Ray Newby, was published by The Diamondback critiquing the university’s decision to go through with the plans for the new performance center, calling the action a waste of money.</p>

  <p>“It’s shameful to watch this university compete in such a petty competition to win the affection of young athletes, and further fuel the cycle of unnecessary commercialization in college athletics,” sophomore Ray Newby said.</p.>

  <p>Newby’s reasoning is that money would be better spent to improve general campus concerns like re-occurring mold issues and renovations to dormitories, including adding air conditioning to all buildings.</p>

  <p>Maryland’s athletic director, Damon Evans, announced that the $36 million will be provided entirely by private donors through a fundraising campaign, during a news conference on October 8.</p>

  <p>“This is a $36-million-dollar project that will be funded by the generous support of our donors and our friends,” Evans said. “We have already raised to date $19-million-dollars. A testament to our development staff and our passionate fan base.”</p>

  <p>During the 2017-18 school year, the Maryland athletic department acquired $98 million in revenue, according to the USA Today’s NCAA Finances database. This total ranked them 40th nationally, but last among universities that reported their revenues in the Big Ten. Northwestern is a private university and therefore does not have to report its revenue. </p>

  <p>More than half of the revenue acquired by the department was from rights and licensing, the majority of which includes the university’s deal with the Big Ten Network.</p>

  <p>A major reason for Maryland joining the Big Ten was to become more financially stable, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2012/11/19/maryland-leaves-acc-for-big-ten/1715635/">university president Wallace Loh</a> said in 2012. If Maryland was still an ACC school, they would have the seventh most revenue in the conference. However, the program would not have received any money form the Big Ten Network deal, which makes up close to half of their revenue.</p>

  <p>Students enrolled part-time at the university pay a $68 athletic fee. However, students that are enrolled full time, are required to pay a $203 athletic fee. These fees enable students to get tickets to Maryland athletic events.</p>

  <p>As a result, the university collected just over $12 million in student fees that went straight to the athletic department.</p>

  <p>Criticism is prominent from some students on campus about the way money has been budgeted. Much of the student’s anger can be attributed to a lack of knowledge about how resources are handled.</p>

  <p>“I really wish people understood how university finances work,” senior Kyle Tregoning said. “The funds come from donors specifically for athletic buildings. Also, (he speculated) the athletic buildings bring in more money than the academic buildings.”</p>

  <p>Building the new basketball performance center will allow for less scheduling conflicts and will allow the university to schedule more events and concerts at the Xfinity Center. All of which will allow the university to make additional revenue.</p>

  <p>With the Cole Field House renovations set to be <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/terps/bs-sp-maryland-football-cole-field-house-tour-20190916-yuph7kn2vrhstkazmt2ypasqdm-story.html">completed soon</a> and the basketball performance center set to be built soon being, it will only be a matter of time to see if the combined $232 million investment was worth it. However, the battle between students and the athletic department will likely continue.</p>
